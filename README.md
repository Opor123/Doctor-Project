# AI Doctor

## Overview

The **AI Doctor** is designed to tackle one of the biggest challenges in healthcare: the overwhelming number of patients requiring detailed symptom analysis for accurate diagnosis.  
Doctors often need to assess multiple symptoms in great detail, which can be time-consuming and lead to delays in patient care. This AI model aims to assist in the early prediction of potential medical conditions, helping streamline the diagnostic process.

## Focus

Our focus is on prediction, assisting the medical field by reducing diagnosis time. This AI does **not** provide a definitive diagnosis; instead, it serves as an initial prediction tool to highlight potential concerns. A final diagnosis must still be confirmed by a medical professional using detailed medical data.

## Output

The model will be accessible through a **web-based** interface, allowing users to input relevant information and receive predictive insights.
